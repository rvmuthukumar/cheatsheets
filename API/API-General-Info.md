## What is an API
- API : Application Programming Interface
- Used to send or receive data
- It is a bridge between different S/W systems - to interact and exchange data




## API Benefits
- Real-time data access (for AI services for real time inference)
- Large datasets access and integration
- Pre-Processed data

## When to use API
- Rapidly changing datas
- when needing a specific subset of data
- Complex computation results (Ex results of AI models)
- Use cases
    - Access to AI Models
    - Data Acquisition
    - AI Powered services and their integration into applications
    - Ecommerce - Online stores use API to connect with payment processors
    - IoT Devices - ex fitness trackers using API to communicate data to servers or other devices

## Example APIs

    - The World Bank API


## HTTP Verbs & Different API Methods
- When consuming API, you need to figure out what type of API request you make
- 4 Common Types and associated HTTP Verbs
    - To Retrieve               :   GET
    - To send new data          :   POST
    - To update existing data   :   PUT
    - To remove data            :   DELETE



## Best Practices
- Analyze API documentation in detail
