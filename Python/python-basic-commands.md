## Underscore usage in Python
    * Variable conventions
        -   _ often used as a throwaway variable when you dont need to use it again - mostly in the loop
        - _variable : convention used to indicate a variable scope is internal and ONLY within a class
        - __variable : helps avoid naming conflicts in subclass
        - variable_  : to avoid naming conflict with python keywords   e.g class_
        - __variable__ : naming convention used to define variables internally
    * Interactive Interpretor  or Annonymous variable or ignored variable or unimportant variable
        - _ variable stores the last executed expression - used to get the previous result


## Use of *
    - args*  : used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function
    - kwargs**  : used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function
